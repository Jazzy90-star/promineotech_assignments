                        Each night he awakens a little earlier until he's barely sleeping at all. 
                        During his late night vigils and walks, he observes some strange things going on in Derry,
                        Maine. He sees colored ribbons streaming from people's heads. He witnesses two strange little men
                        wandering the city under cover of night. He begins to suspect that these visions are something more than hallucinations brought about by
                        sleep deprivation. Ralph and his friend, widow Lois Chasse, become enmeshed in events of cosmic significance. </p1>
